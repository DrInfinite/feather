**Feather** is a small, minimal and rugged reactive UI framework, built for speed, reliability and simplicity.

It takes a pragmatic approach towards developing modern web applications, while adopting a few familiar traits from the golden days of the web.

Simple and Lightweight, Feather helps you compose behavior as part of your markup, much like jQuery, while introducing a more powerful way to handle reactivity.

Some of Feather's stand out features are as follows:
- No config necessay
- No build step involved
